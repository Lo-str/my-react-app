Create your first React project (Portfolio), follow these steps in the terminal:

1. npm create vite@latest
2. name of your project
3. pick a framework – React
4. pick a language – JavaScript
5. cd ”your project name”
6. npm install
7. npm run dev

Pay close attention to step 5. This will make sure that you are in the right folder before you run npm install and npm run dev.

In this assignment you will be creating your own reusable components

Create at least 3 components, these components will represent your previous projects. Each component will include these props:

1. Name
2. Screenshot
3. Github repo
4. Tech used
5. A short write-up

· What the project does
· What you learned
· Your role (if it was collaborative)
· Challenges you solved

Make sure to pass these values down as props so that you can customize your components. You are going to be working on this project for future assignments so make sure that it looks the way that you want it to.

You will have complete freedom in designing this project, so make sure to use your HTML/CSS skills.
